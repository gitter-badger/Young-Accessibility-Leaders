## What is Young Accessibility Leaders?

Our goal is to create an open curriculum for middle and high schoolers to learn about Assistive Technology - any and all tools used by people with disabilities. It consists of a series of lessons where students will get an insider look on the world of disability and technology by building assistive devices. This way, we hope to inspire a generation of future engineers to use their skills to effect change to their communities.

To expand this curriculum, we need help from many different contributors! In the next section, you can see how you can help. 

## Terminology

We're doing our best to keep the documentation jargon-free, but there are some technical terms you will inevitably come across. Here's a few:

*Assistive Technology*: Any item, piece of equipment, or system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities<sup>1</sup>.

*Accessibility*: The ability of a product, service, or system to be accessed by people with disabilities<sup>2</sup>.

*Project*: The Young Accessibility Leaders curriculum consists of a series of creative exercises where students are tasked with creating an assistive device by following instructions. Those exercises will be called Projects (capitalized!) from here on. 

## Who Can Contribute?

There are many different ways to help! Young Accessibility Leaders doubles as a platform where educators, disability professionals, and people with disabilities can collaborate, but we're also looking for skills anyone can have. 

### Contributor Profiles

We're looking for:

**Teachers in Secondary Education** who teach IT, robotics, or other technical subjects in project-oriented classes. If you are one, you're also our target audience!

**People with Disabilities, Disability Professionals, or Disability Organizations** willing to offer feedback about the learning materials in the curriculum. 

**Developers, Engineers, and Makers** willing to offer feedback about the technical parts of the curriculum. 

**Other Contributors** eager to help with translation, captioning, and other important stuff. 

## Contributor Guidelines

This section will explain how you can contribute in detail.

### Teachers in Secondary Education

You're our main user base, so your feedback is invaluable! Here's some things you can help us with:

- **Evaluate the learning materials.** Are the presentations comprehensive? Are the teacher's guides helpful? Are the overall learning goals of each project relevant? All criticism is welcome so long as it's constructive!

- **Suggest a new Project!** Projects are the core of Young Accessibility Leaders. You can help expand the curriculum by proposing a new Project, and you can even help design it (or simply design it and then submit it to our documentation). If you have a Project idea, you can start by opening a new issue. More instructions coming soon! :construction:

- **Request a Translation.** Expanding the scope of Young Accessibility Leaders is one of our main goals. If you want a portion of the curriculum translated into your language, you can open an issue requesting it. You can also contribute by doing some translating yourself.

### People with Disabilities

If you're a person with a disability or run a disability organization, we value your insight a lot! Here's how you can contribute:

- **Evaluate the learning materials.** Do the materials represent your disability and the accessibility problems you're facing? Do the Projects reflect real-world accessibility issues? Is there anything you think is missing?

- **Suggest a new Project!** Have an idea about a Project that tackles an existing accessibility issue? Open an issue and let us know!

- **Let us know if something is ableist.**  We're doing our best to disallow discriminatory language or imagery, but please let us know if we've overlooked something. 

- **Report an accessibility issue** in the materials or on the site.

### Disability Professionals

If you're a medical professional, someone who works with people with disabilities, or someone involved in Disability Studies, here are some ways you can help:

- **Evaluate the learning materials.** Are the medical depictions of disability accurate? Did we overlook something ableist? 

- **Evaluate Project impact.** How could a Project potentially help people with disabilities in a medical or community context?

- **Suggest a new Project!** Have an idea about a Project that tackles an existing accessibility issue? Open an issue and let us know!

- **Report an accessibility issue** in the materials or on the site.

### Developers

Are you a developer, engineer, or maker? Take a look at how you can contribute:

- **Check Project code.** Are we missing something? See a bug? Could the code be written better or made more comprehensible?

- **Suggest a new Project!** Have an idea about a Project that tackles an existing accessibility issue? Open an issue and let us know! 

- **Report an accessibility issue** in the materials or on the site.

### Other Contributors

If you lack the specific skills required to do any of the above but still want to help, you can still help a lot by doing the following:

- **Help us translate the curriculum!** In order to make Young Accessibility Leaders available to as many educators as possible, it needs to be translated into more languages than just English and Greek. 

- **Help us with accessibility!** Providing alt-texts for images and closed captions for videos is very important, and anyone can do it.

- **See something wrong? Tell us!** It can be a bug or just a typo. Open an issue and let us know. 

## Roadmap

Our Roadmap is where we catalogue our goals ("milestones") and the tasks we need to get out of the way to achieve them. You can find it [here](https://github.com/theo-bech/Young-Accessibility-Leaders/issues/1).

## General Guidelines 

If you're making any kind of contribution, there are certain rules you have to stick to. First, you have to adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/theo-bech/Young-Accessibility-Leaders/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you're producing content, you have to make it accessible. Provide alt-text for images, closed captions for videos, and content warnings for disturbing materials. A more detailed list of guidelines will be uploaded soon! :construction:
