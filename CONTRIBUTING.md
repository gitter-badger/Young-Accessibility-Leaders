## What is Young Accessibility Leaders?

Our goal is to create an open curriculum for middle and high schoolers to learn about Assistive Technology - any and all tools used by people with disabilities. It consists of a series of lessons where students will get an insider look on the world of disability and technology by building assistive devices. This way, we hope to inspire a generation of future engineers to use their skills to effect change to their communities.

To expand this curriculum, we need help from many different contributors! In the next section, you can see how you can help. 

## Terminology

We're doing our best to keep the documentation jargon-free, but there are some technical terms you will inevitably come across. Here's a few:

*Assistive Technology*: Any item, piece of equipment, or system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities[^1].

*Accessibility*: The ability of a product, service, or system to be accessed by people with disabilities[^2].

*Project*: The Young Accessibility Leaders curriculum consists of a series of creative exercises where students are tasked with creating an assistive device by following instructions. Those exercises will be called Projects (capitalized!) from here on. 

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many different ways to help! Young Accessibility Leaders doubles as a platform where educators, disability professionals, and people with disabilities can collaborate, but we're also looking for skills anyone can have. 

### Contributor Profiles

We're looking for:

**Teachers in Secondary Education** who teach IT, robotics, or other technical subjects in project-oriented classes. If you are one, you're also our target audience!

**People with Disabilities, Disability Professionals, or Disability Organizations** willing to offer feedback about the learning materials in the curriculum. 

**Developers, Engineers, and Makers** willing to offer feedback about the technical parts of the curriculum. 

**Other Contributors** eager to help with translation, captioning, and other important stuff. 

### Contributor Guidelines

If you fit into the "Other Contributors" category, head on to the next section. If not, this section will explain how you can contribute in detail.

**Teachers in Secondary Education**

You're our main user base, so your feedback is invaluable! Here's some things you can help us with:

- **Evaluate the learning materials.** Are the presentations comprehensive? Are the teacher's guides helpful? Are the overall learning goals of each project relevant? All criticism is welcome so long as it's constructive!
- **Suggest a new Project!** Projects are the core of Young Accessibility Leaders. You can help expand the curriculum by proposing a new Project, and you can even help design it (or simply design it and then submit it to our documentation). If you have a Project idea, you can start by opening a new issue. More instructions coming soon! :construction:
- **Request a Translation.** Expanding the scope of Young Accessibility Leaders is one of our main goals. If you want a portion of the curriculum translated into your language, you can open an issue requesting it. You can also contribute by doing some translating yourself.
