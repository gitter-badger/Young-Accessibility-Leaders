Hello and welcome to Young Accessibility Leaders! Thank you for taking a look, we're excited to have you ðŸŽ‰

**What's Young Accessibility Leaders about?** 

Our goal is to create an open curriculum for middle and high schoolers to learn about Assistive Technology - any and all tools used by people with disabilities. It consists of a series of lessons where students will get an insider look on the world of disability and technology by building assistive devices (Projects), learning about accessibility and getting hands-on skills on the way. This way, we hope to inspire a generation of future engineers to use their skills to effect change in their communities.

What makes our project exciting is that it's open! This means educators will have full access to learning materials, presentations, and teacher's guides! See [LICENSE.md](

      ) for more.
